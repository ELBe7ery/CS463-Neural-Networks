# CSE463 Neural Networks

The repository contains all the projects that i have made during the class. Each project has **Its own branch** 

## How to use
1. Clone the repository into a local directory
2. To view a project you can `git checkout` into the appropriate git branch


## Current projects and Branches

Project | branch name and git command| Comments 
--- | --- | ---
notebooks<br/>Till lab 2 | `git checkout notebook` | 
K nearest neighbors classifier | `git checkout KNN` | A classifier built around the KNN algorithm operated on the cifar-10 data set
Feed-forward neural network | `git checkout ffnn` | A neural network based classifier for the cifar-10 data set
Assignment 1 | `git checkout assig1` | A neural network implementation from scratch using `numpy`<br/>Keras Cifar-10 neural network based classifier
